#Paxos Implementation
##Overview
Paxos is a neat algorithm to solve the consensus problem. It was firstly described in <a href="http://www.lamport.org" target="_blank">Leslie Lamport's </a> paper (<a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/paxos-simple.pdf" target="_blank">Paxos Made Simple</a>). Paxos is considered as one of the hardest algorithm to understand, however, I have to confess it is really a neat algorithm after I finaly figured out how it works to avoid conflicts when different values are proposed at almost the same time from different clients and make all the nodes in a system agree with only one value. We assume that every node will just stop if it fails, and we don't need to worry about Byzantine failure.
